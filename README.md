## ðŸ“œ Motivation
<span style="margin-botton: 5px">
This project was developed to improve my skills in JavaScript, Vue 3 and Three.js.
<br>
Was created to offer a minimal template for integration of Vue 3 with composition API and Three.js.
</span>

## ðŸŽ¯ Description
<span style="margin-botton: 5px">
    Using Three.js to be capable of loading and manipulating 3D graphics (light, materials, 3d models, and others) on a web browser. For this, a module of Three.js is required on Vue component and all manipulations are made to inject and render a scene instance on HTML canvas element referenced by a vue reactive variable.
    <br>
    In Vue3 the a 'setup' is used in place of methods, date and other things commonly used in Options API, and it is for this exact context that this little project was designed.
    <br>
    This project structure was made using Vite, a new and performative bundler for Javascript projects.
